# Contributing to Sleepless

Thanks for your interest. Sleepless is a deliberately tiny, single-purpose menu-bar app,
so the bar for changes is "does it keep the thing small, honest, and native?"

## Ways to help

- **Report a bug** — use the bug-report issue form. Include your exact macOS version
  (`sw_vers`), your Mac model (`sysctl -n hw.model`), and what `pmset -g | grep SleepDisabled`
  reports before/after the problem.
- **Request a feature** — use the feature-request form. Features that grow the privilege
  surface (more sudo, a helper daemon, kexts) are unlikely to land; the security model is a
  core feature, not an obstacle.
- **Improve docs / translations** — README fixes and new/updated `README.<lang>.md` files
  are very welcome. Keep section order identical to the English README; never translate code
  blocks, URLs, or image paths.
- **Code** — bug fixes and small, focused improvements.

## Building locally

No Xcode project — just the Command Line Tools:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Aboudjem/Sleepless.git
cd Sleepless
./build.sh            # builds ./build/Sleepless.app, ad-hoc signed
open build/Sleepless.app
```

`./install.sh` additionally installs the passwordless grant + login item (it prints exactly
what it writes). `./uninstall.sh` backs it all out and proves the grant is revoked.

## Coding guidelines

- **Keep it native.** Sleepless uses AppKit + SF Symbols. No third-party dependencies, no
  hand-drawn glyphs, no bundled frameworks.
- **Zero warnings.** The build must compile clean:
  ```sh
  swiftc -O -parse-as-library -target arm64-apple-macos26.0 -framework AppKit App.swift Core/*.swift -o /tmp/Sleepless
  ```
  CI runs the equivalent compile on every push/PR.
- **Tests.** Logic that doesn't need AppKit lives in `Core/` and is covered by `swift test`
  (Swift Testing). `Package.swift` exists only for that; the app is still built by `build.sh`.
- **Match the surrounding style.** Read `App.swift` first — keep comment density, naming, and
  the "read back the real system state, never assume" discipline.
- **No personal paths or usernames** in scripts, the sudoers template, or install commands.
  The grant is generated from `$(id -un)` at install time.
- **Verify on a real machine.** Sleepless is verified on macOS 26 (Tahoe) / Apple Silicon.
  If you test on other versions/hardware, say so in the PR.

## Pull requests

1. Fork, branch from `main`.
2. Keep the diff focused; one logical change per PR.
3. Make sure the build is clean and the app launches.
4. Fill in the PR template (what changed, how you tested, macOS version).
