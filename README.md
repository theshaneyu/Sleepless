> [!NOTE]
> A closed lid sleeps your Mac, and `caffeinate` apps (KeepingYouAwake and friends) can't change that, by design. Sleepless flips the one setting that can, `pmset disablesleep`, with safety nets so it is safe to forget.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask aboudjem/tap/sleepless
/Applications/Sleepless.app/Contents/Resources/grant.sh   # one-time passwordless grant
```

| Other ways | |
|---|---|
| **Download** | Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/Aboudjem/Sleepless/releases/latest), unzip to `/Applications`, then approve it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** (it is ad-hoc signed). |
| **Build from source** | `git clone https://github.com/Aboudjem/Sleepless.git && cd Sleepless && ./install.sh` (no Gatekeeper prompt). |

Then click the cup in the menu bar, flip the switch, and close the lid.

## Features

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ☕ | **One switch** | Click the menu-bar cup, flip the toggle. |
| ⏲️ | **Auto-off timer** | 1h or 2h with a live countdown, then off. |
| 🔋 | **Battery floor** | Auto-off at 5–50% on battery (default 15%). |
| 🖥️ | **No dongle** | Lid closed, on battery. No monitor, no HDMI plug. |
| 🚀 | **Launch at login** | Optional, off by default, always starts idle. |
| 🪶 | **Tiny + native** | One AppKit file. No Dock icon, daemon, or kext. |

**Menu-bar glyph:** empty cup = off · full cup = awake · full cup + dot = awake on battery (auto-off live).

<sub>As of 2026-06. ¹ Uses `pmset disablesleep` and reads the flag back; behavior is hardware/macOS-version dependent. ² Documents closed-display mode but is widely reported to fail on Apple Silicon on power-source changes ([AE #28](https://github.com/x74353/Amphetamine-Enhancer/issues/28)); the app is closed source. ³ Can't do lid-closed by design, it wraps `caffeinate` ([#66](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/66)). ⁴ `caffeinate -i` runs on battery; `-s` is AC-only.</sub>

## Use it to

- 🤖 Finish overnight jobs lid-closed: agent runs, builds, renders, ML training.
- 📡 Share a hotspot from your bag.
- ⬇️ Leave big downloads, uploads, or backups running.
- 🖥️ Keep a local server or SSH session reachable.

> [!TIP]
> Set a battery floor you trust (say 20%) plus a timer, and you can walk away without babysitting the battery.

## How it works

Sleepless toggles `pmset disablesleep` (the kernel's `SleepDisabled` flag), reads it back so the menu bar never lies, and reverts it at your battery floor, when the timer ends, or on reboot. A GUI app can't type a password, so the installer adds a scoped sudoers rule for **exactly two commands**:

```
<you> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep 0, /usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep 1
```

- **Can't be widened.** sudoers matches arguments literally, no wildcards.
- **Nothing to hijack.** No daemon, no helper script, no shell. It calls `/usr/bin/pmset` directly.
- **Always reversible.** Reboot, the floor, the timer, or `./uninstall.sh` (which proves the grant is gone).

Verify a download, no Apple account needed:

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
gh attestation verify Sleepless-*.zip -R Aboudjem/Sleepless
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does <code>pmset disablesleep</code> still work on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?</b></summary>

Yes. `pmset -a disablesleep 1` sets the kernel's `SleepDisabled` flag on Apple Silicon, confirmed firsthand on macOS 26.3, which keeps the Mac awake with the lid closed on battery. Verify with `pmset -g | grep SleepDisabled` (it should read `1`). Claims that it "stopped working" usually describe `caffeinate` or caffeinate-based apps, a different mechanism.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does my Mac sleep on lid close even with Amphetamine or KeepingYouAwake?</b></summary>

Those use macOS power assertions, which stop the idle timer but can't override the hardware lid-close trigger. KeepingYouAwake wraps `caffeinate`, which can't do lid-closed ([#66](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/66)). `pmset disablesleep`, which Sleepless uses, can.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it safe? Will it overheat or drain the battery?</b></summary>

It is safe for light unattended work (downloads, syncs, a hotspot). Heavy sustained load with the lid fully shut reduces airflow, so use judgement. The battery floor and the timer both stop it before it drains the Mac.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it need sudo, a kernel extension, or a daemon?</b></summary>

One tightly scoped `sudo` grant (two exact `pmset` commands) so a GUI app can flip the setting without a prompt. No kernel extension, no daemon. The whole app is a single AppKit file.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I stop it or remove it?</b></summary>

Flip the switch off, or let the timer or battery floor do it, and normal sleep returns. A reboot also resets it. `./uninstall.sh` removes the app, login item, and the sudoers grant, then proves the grant is gone.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why isn't it notarized?</b></summary>

It is a personal open-source tool with no paid Apple Developer ID, so it is ad-hoc signed. Build from source to skip Gatekeeper, or use **Open Anyway** for the prebuilt app. The notarization steps are documented in [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md).
